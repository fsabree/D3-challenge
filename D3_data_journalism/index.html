          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Healthcare, Obesity</h2>
          <p>The table above takes the 
            <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2014 ACS 1-year estimates</a>
            and looks at obesity and the correlation it has between the percentage of those who live in poverty and those that lack healthcare by state.</p>
          
          <h5>Poverty vs. Obesity</h5>

          <p>First we will take a look at obesity and the percentage of those that live in poverty.  The data shows that there is a positive correlation between poverty and obesity.
            The obesity rates are higher for those states that have a higher poverty percentage.  For example, Mississippi has the highest poverty and obesity rate. How is poverty linked to obesity? 
            It has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts, meaning that they have less 
            access to fresh foods. households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure (uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, sufficient food).  Thus, in many poverty-dense 
            regions, people are in hunger and unable to access affordable healthy food, even when funds avail. </p>

          <p>Another factor is evidence of the association between sedentariness, poor health, obesity, diabetes.  Sedentary individuals move 2 h per day less than active individuals 
            and expend less energy, and they are thereby prone to obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and cardiovascular death.  Overall, the poorest counties have the greatest
            sedentariness and obesity.
            Several reasons may explain why people living in poor counties are less active. One reason may be that violence tracks with poverty, thereby preventing people from being 
            active out-of-doors. Similarly, parks and sports facilities are less available to people living in poor counties, and people who live in poverty-dense regions may be 
            less able to afford gym membership, sports clothing, and/or exercise equipment. There are multiple individual and environmental reasons to explain why poverty-dense counties 
            may be more sedentary and bear greater obesity burdens.</p>

          <h5>Healthcare vs. Obesity</h5>

          <p>The data shows that there is some correlation between healthcare and obesity.  Those states that lack healthcare have high obesity rates.
            There are some states that have low healthcare percentages but a high obesity rate (Hawaii, Massachussets).  Further research will need to be completed to understand why that is.
            Those that become obese and lack proper healthcare have the ability to develop obesity-related ailments requiring medical treatment—such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease,
            and kidney failure.
